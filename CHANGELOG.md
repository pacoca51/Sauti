		* The old interface is deprecated and will be completely removed in the future
	* Add JSON as a backend (co-exists with XML)
		* JSON is now prefered and used by default
		* Compatibility to old data (XML format) is kept
			* When saving (editing) from a old data, it will be stored to JSON format
		* The old XML backend exists and there isn't a current plan to remove it
	* Handling (saving, editing, listing) of events and profiles should be faster now
	* Large refactoring (e.g. generify lots of classes) related to the data storage backend

* v0.4.2.1: UI improvements
	* Better UI of the page for editing events
		* Text size/spacing (especially for Chinese)

		* remove the need of static method `OerationPlugin.pname()` and `EventPlugin.pname()` in the implementation of event plugins (not in the interface)
	* Rename `ryey.easer.core.ui.edit.PluginViewFragment` to `ryey.easer.core.ui.edit.PluginViewContainerFragment` to avoid name duplication with `ryey.easer.commons.plugindef.PluginViewFragment` (which was introduced in v0.4)
