Extend Easer
=====

Extending the functionality of Easer (by adding more *Event*s or *Operation*s) is really simple (and is becoming simpler).

The document [HOWTO](HOWTO.md) describes how to add a new *Event* or *Operation*.

The document [TODO](TODO.md) lists some plausible (and necessary) enhancements to Easer, including some un-developed *Event* and *Operation*.
